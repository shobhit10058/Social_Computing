Run the file gen_centrality.py and analyze_centrality.py only within 19EC10058 folder, from other folder it might give error.
i.e Run the files by python gen_centrality.py and python analyze_centrality.py 

The estimated run time of the gen_centrality.py is 7-8 minutes. Most of the time is taken by the 
calculation of closenessCentrality and betweenness centrality. This was calculated using the brandes algorithm
to minimize runtime.

The analyze_centrality.py runs pretty fast and executes in less than 1 minute.
